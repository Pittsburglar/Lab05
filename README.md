The calculator program will start by taking two user inputs, which will be the numbers used to calculate a number. Afterwards, the program will ask for an operator that will be used in the calculation. If the operator is valid, a number will be calculated and printed. If the operator is not valid, it will continue to ask for a valid operator until it recieves one.

You are currently running calculatior v1.0. The program can be found in /home/Lab05. In order to use the program, all you need to do is input two numbers and one of the valid operators, which are given to you. Afterwards, you need to do no more work as the program will run as intended.

If you would like to contribute to the calculator, to greatly increase its uses and features, consider adding new operations or functions that are able to calculate more than basic arithmetic. On top of that, it would be greatly appreciated if anyone could find ways to simplify the code or make in=t run more efficiently.
